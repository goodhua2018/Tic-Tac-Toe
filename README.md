## :rocket: Cool tech

- HTML
- CSS


## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- if a box is taken by X or O, they can be changed by another click. ---fixed
- when a player wins, the other empty box still can be clicked and filled --- fixed
- if the last step, the last box is filled, if a player wins, still show "a draw" --- fixed

## :sob: Lessons learnt
when a box is clicked, the id pushed into clicked array to store. I learnt that they are strings not numbers

## :white_check_mark: Future features
Now, player 1 is always X and player 2 is always O. will make an option which player get the first step, which image the player would like to use. For example, player 1 can choose to be O, not always X; or player 2 can be the first step.
